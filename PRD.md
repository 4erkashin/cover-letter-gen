# PRD: Greenfield Alt+Shift cover-letter app

## Summary

Greenfield Alt+Shift cover-letter app (informed by v2, **not** a port): Reshaped UI; three primary screens (dashboard / create / edit) plus informed error screens (Cover Letter not-found; unknown-route 404); required generation-status animation; browser persistence with cross-tab sync; AI generation via AI SDK (`generateText`) + Server Actions.

Domain language: **Cover Letter** (see `CONTEXT.md`). UI copy may say “application(s)” per mock — that is presentation only, not a second entity.

**Goal** = distinct saved Cover Letters (list length); target **5**. Banner while `n < 5`. **Try Again** overwrites the same id and does **not** +1 the goal.

This file is the durable product source of truth (relocated from [PRD GitHub issue](https://github.com/4erkashin/cover-letter-gen/issues/11), handoff from [Map: Cover letter app handoff PRD](https://github.com/4erkashin/cover-letter-gen/issues/1)). Ready for `/implement` or `/to-tickets` — no further product decisions required.

---

## Scope / non-goals

### In scope

- Next.js app with Reshaped; routes and behaviors below
- Client persistence (Nanostores-style `localStorage` + cross-tab sync, as in v2)
- Cheap/fast Flash-class model, swappable; streaming **not** required for v1 animation
- Mobile: single-column adaptation of the same screens
- Brand: Alt+Shift

### Post-PRD delivery obligations (implement / ship; not blocking this PRD)

- Decision Log in README
- README AI-workflow blurb (tools / where AI helped / what you finished by hand)
- Deploy demo link (e.g. Vercel)

Tracked separately: [Ship obligations (README Decision Log, AI workflow, deploy)](https://github.com/4erkashin/cover-letter-gen/issues/20).

### Named implementer discretion

- Prompt quality bar
- Toast library / undo duration
- Exact mobile breakpoints

### Non-goals

- Implementing or deploying as part of the original wayfinder map (map stopped at this PRD)
- Porting v1/v2 wholesale or cloning the sample’s FSD/Vite architecture
- Custom design system instead of Reshaped
- Renaming the domain concept to Application
- Streaming token UI as the generation animation
- Teaching Figma→AI codegen in this PRD body (belongs in README / Notes; see linked research)

## Screens & navigation

| Screen    | Path    |
| --------- | ------- |
| Dashboard | `/`     |
| Create    | `/new`  |
| Edit      | `/[id]` |

### Navigation rules

- **List card** body → `/[id]`; **Delete** / **Copy** do not navigate
- **Header Home** → `/` from every screen
- **Brand / logo** → `/`; non-tabbable when already on dashboard
- **Every + Create New / Hit your goal CTA** (dashboard header, dashboard banner, edit banner) → `/new`
- **Successful Generate Now** on create → **`replace`** to `/[id]` (Back does not reopen empty create)
- **Create generation failure** → stay on `/new`; keep form; write nothing
- **Try Again** on edit → stay on `/[id]`; overwrite in place; URL unchanged

### Error screens

- Missing / deleted `/[id]` → informed **not-found** (brand + Home chrome); primary CTA → `/`; **no** silent redirect
- Any path outside `/`, `/new`, `/[id]` → shared **unknown-route 404** (same pattern)
- Generation failures remain in-place toast/alert (not separate routes)

## UI states checklist

Nine screenshot-backed states (pass/fail “matches mockup”). Sources under `.wayfinder/screenshots/`. Full inventory: [`docs/research/figma-screenshot-inventory.md`](https://github.com/4erkashin/cover-letter-gen/blob/research/figma-screenshot-inventory/docs/research/figma-screenshot-inventory.md) on `research/figma-screenshot-inventory`.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1. **Dashboard / goal in progress** — H1 **Applications**, **+ Create New**, cards (Delete + Copy), `{n}/5 applications generated` + 5-dot header, **Hit your goal** banner (segments + `{n} out of 5`)
2. **Dashboard / goal achieved** — `5/5` + green check, **no** banner; Create New remains
3. **Create / empty** — **New application**, four fields, `0/1200` + placeholder, muted Generate Now, empty preview
4. **Create / filled** — dynamic `{Job title}, {Company}` title, live counter &lt;1200, green Generate Now
5. **Create / validation** — red Additional details + red `&gt;1200/1200`, Generate Now disabled
6–7. **Loading (in flight)** — button spinner replaces Generate Now / Try Again; preview uses **sample Preloader** (see Generation). Figma `loading-*-keyframe` PNGs are **mood/reference only** — not morph acceptance
8. **Edit / in progress** — Try Again + letter preview + Hit-your-goal banner
9. **Edit / achieved** — Try Again + preview + check header, **no** banner

### Cross-cutting mock fidelity

- Alt+Shift chrome (wordmark + mark)
- Fields: **Job title**, **Company**, **I am good at…**, **Additional details** (max **1200**); counter format `{current}/1200`; over-limit red chrome
- Additional details empty placeholder: **Describe why you are a great fit or paste your bio**
- Preview empty: **Your personalized job application will appear here...**
- Header ↔ banner synced to **one** list-length `n` (ignore Figma stubs where counts disagree or counter shows `0/1200` with text present)
- Banner copy when shown: heading **Hit your goal**; subcopy **Generate and send out couple more job applications today to get hired faster** (exact phrasing); CTA **+ Create New**; meter `{n} out of 5`

## Goal, banner & persistence

- Goal target = **5** distinct saved Cover Letters; progress = **list length**
- Banner visible while `n < 5`; **absent** at `n ≥ 5`
- **Try Again** does not increment goal
- Field edits on edit are local until regenerate; **leave discards** unsaved field edits
- **Delete**: instant + undo toast
- Browser persistence with **cross-tab sync** (v2-informed Nanostores `localStorage` pattern)

---

## Generation

### AI

- AI SDK Server Action + `generateText`
- Model: cheap/fast Flash-class; **swappable**
- No streaming required for v1 animation

### Loading animation (create **and** Try Again)

Required package ([Specify generation loading animation for the PRD](https://github.com/4erkashin/cover-letter-gen/issues/3); prototype `prototype/generation-loading-animation`, route `/prototype/generation-animation?variant=B`):

**In flight**

- Form stays on screen (not a full-page spinner)
- Primary button: label replaced by white spinner on green control; accessible name e.g. `aria-label="Generating…"`
- Preview: sample-style **Preloader** — fixed ~160×160 soft white/blurred sphere, `1s ease-in-out` infinite alternate bounce (`translateY` 0→16px, opacity 1→0.48). Canonical: sample `Preloader` / `Preloader.module.css`
- Figma loading PNGs = mood only

**Success**

- Letter reveal: opacity + slight rise, ~**320ms ease-out**

**Failure**

- Stop animation; keep form; announced error toast/alert
- Create failure: write nothing
- Edit failure: keep last-good preview

**Accessibility (all required)**

1. `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` — no bounce, no letter rise/fade; preview shows **Generating…**; button still busy
2. Button accessible name while spinner replaces label; restore Generate Now / Try Again when idle
3. Preview `aria-busy="true"` while generating; labeled region (e.g. “Generated letter preview”)
4. `aria-live` (polite) — announce start, success, failure
5. Failure announced as above

## Design system & folder layout

Reshaped + prescribed folders (not sample FSD):

`app/` · `domain/` · `features/` · `ui/`

Thin `ui/` wrappers only where assignment-specific (e.g. `CharCounter`, CTA modes, `CopyButton`, `CreateNewButton`) — not a full Reshaped façade.

Entity patterns: `Letter*` (`LetterCard`, `LetterForm`, `LetterPreview`, …). Chrome: `AppHeader`, `GoalHeader`, `HomeButton`, `GoalBanner`, `ProgressTracker`, etc.

| Pattern                  | Home        | Role                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AppHeader`              | `ui/`       | Alt+Shift brand + goal chrome + Home                                   |
| `GoalHeader`             | `ui/`       | `{n}/5 applications generated` + dots **or** check                     |
| `HomeButton`             | `ui/`       | House → `/`                                                            |
| `GoalBanner`             | `ui/`       | Hit your goal; hide when `n ≥ 5`                                       |
| `ProgressTracker`        | `ui/`       | Compact dots (header) + large segments (banner); one `n` = list length |
| `CreateNewButton`        | `ui/`       | `+ Create New`                                                         |
| `CopyButton`             | `ui/`       | Copy (disabled when preview empty)                                     |
| `LetterCard`             | `ui/`       | Truncated preview + Delete + Copy → edit                               |
| `CharCounter`            | `ui/`       | `{current}/1200` + over-limit chrome                                   |
| `FormHeader`             | `ui/`       | “New application” → `{Job title}, {Company}`                           |
| `LetterPreview`          | `ui/`       | Placeholder / letter / Preloader + Copy                                |
| `FormPreviewShell`       | `ui/`       | 2-col form + preview layout                                            |
| `LetterForm` + CTA modes | `features/` | Four fields; Generate Now / Try Again / disabled / spinner             |
| Dashboard page chrome    | `features/` | Applications H1 + Create New + card grid                               |

Loading fidelity owned via `LetterPreview` + submit modes (animation ticket).

## Edge cases & locked copy

### Empty dashboard (list area; banner still follows `n < 5`)

| Slot       | Copy                                                       |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Headline   | **No applications yet**                                    |
| Supporting | **Create your first one and it will show up here.**        |
| CTA        | **Create New** (same plus-icon control as header / banner) |

Source: [Lock calm dashboard empty-state copy](https://github.com/4erkashin/cover-letter-gen/issues/5)

### Error screens

| Screen                 | Headline                        | Supporting                                                    | CTA            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Cover Letter not-found | **This application isn't here** | **It may have been removed, or the link may be out of date.** | **Home** → `/` |
| Unknown-route 404      | **This page isn't here**        | **The address may be mistyped, or the page may have moved.**  | **Home** → `/` |

Source: [Lock not-found and unknown-route 404 copy](https://github.com/4erkashin/cover-letter-gen/issues/10)

### Other edge cases

- Gen failure: create writes nothing; edit keeps last-good preview
- Delete + undo toast
- Leave discards unsaved field edits
- No silent redirect on missing id / unknown route
